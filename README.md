# MonteCat
The MonteCat Code

#Description
This script follows the proposed MonteCat algorithm that constructs a Regression Model from a big pool of engineered Descriptors (Features) through an adaptation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The number of iterations and the Temperature modulating the Acceptance Probability are determined by the user.
